WiN
===

WiN (Wireless Inter-Home Network) is designed to do what crowd-funding did for projects but for mobile networks. Uses of this could be in businesses to replace wired phone extensions or in place of a pager at a hospital. It could even be used to call your son to dinner! It doesn't require an Internet connection or traditional cellular coverage so it can be completely free.
